    <p><span>R</span>eptiles are cold-blooded (ectothermic) vertebrates with scales or plates on their skin. </strong> They are a diverse group of cold-blooded vertebrate animals belonging to the class Reptilia. They are characterized by several key features, including:</p> 
        
    <p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7of5dIIwvZ8?si=Ql8JTAv84EfbQT3V" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Scales or Scutes: Reptiles typically have scales or scutes covering their bodies. These protective coverings help to prevent water loss and provide some defense against predators.

Terrestrial Adaptations: Most reptiles are adapted to terrestrial (land) environments, although some, like sea turtles, are adapted to aquatic life.

Amniotic Eggs: Reptiles lay amniotic eggs, which have a protective membrane that allows the embryos to develop in a terrestrial environment. This adaptation frees them from the need to lay eggs in water, unlike amphibians.

Ectothermy: Reptiles are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They cannot generate their own body heat like warm-blooded mammals.

Respiratory System: Reptiles typically have lungs for breathing air, unlike amphibians that often rely on both lungs and moist skin for respiration.

Examples of reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and alligators. They are found in a wide range of habitats around the world, from deserts and grasslands to forests and aquatic environments. Reptiles play important roles in ecosystems as predators, prey, and contributors to biodiversity.

It's important to note that while the term "reptile" is widely used, modern biological classifications have evolved, and some groups that were traditionally considered reptiles have been reclassified.</p>

   In 1950, a local breeder named Nina Ennismore began a breeding program to further develop this unique coat type. She crossed Kallibunker with other cats to establish a breeding population. The resulting cats displayed the same distinctive wavy coat and slender body shape.
