Zonkeys are also referred to as zebonkey, zebrinny, zebrula, zebadonks, and several other interesting names, depending on who is breeding them and what combination of donkey and zebra species are being used. Typically, zonkeys are very rare in nature and are usually only seen in zoos or on game-animal farms.

<small class="card-text fs-6">A zorse is a hybrid animal that results from the crossbreeding of a zebra and a horse. The term "zorse" is a portmanteau of "zebra" and "horse." This crossbreeding typically involves a male zebra and a female horse, as the physical and genetic differences between the two species can make it challenging for a female zebra to carry a hybrid pregnancy to term.
Zorses can exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, depending on the specific zebra and horse breeds involved in the cross. They often have stripes reminiscent of a zebra's pattern, usually on their legs, neck, or body. The base coat color can vary, and they might inherit the coloration from either parent.
