    <p><span>F</span>ish are aquatic vertebrates characterized by gills, fins, and typically a streamlined body. They live in water and breathe through their gills. Fish are an important food source for humans and play a significant role in ecosystems.</p>

        Fishes are a diverse group of aquatic vertebrates belonging to the class Osteichthyes or bony fish. They inhabit various aquatic environments, including freshwater and saltwater habitats, ranging from oceans and rivers to lakes and ponds. Fishes play a crucial role in ecosystems as predators, prey, and contributors to nutrient cycling.

        Fishes are characterized by their streamlined body shape, which is adapted for swimming through water. They have fins, which aid in stability, maneuverability, and propulsion. Fins can include dorsal fins, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, anal fins, and caudal fins (tail fins).
        
        Their respiratory system involves gills, specialized structures that extract oxygen from water. Fishes extract oxygen dissolved in water as it passes over the gill filaments, and they release carbon dioxide. This process allows them to respire efficiently in their aquatic environment.</p>
