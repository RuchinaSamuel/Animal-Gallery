    <p><span>A</span>mphibians are a diverse group of cold-blooded vertebrate animals that typically undergo a metamorphic life cycle, transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults.They belong to the class Amphibia, which is divided into three main orders: Anura (frogs and toads), Caudata (salamanders and newts), and Gymnophiona (caecilians).</p> 
    
    <p> <iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XI8GPsf6TAc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen ></iframe>

    Amphibians are characterized by their ability to live both in water and on land, although their skin is usually permeable and requires a moist environment. Many amphibians have unique skin adaptations, such as glands that secrete toxins for defense or to deter predators. They also have lungs for breathing, but many species can also respire through their skin.
    
    Amphibians play important ecological roles, serving as both predators and prey in various ecosystems. They are indicators of environmental health and are sensitive to changes in their habitats, making them valuable subjects of scientific study. Unfortunately, many amphibian populations around the world have been declining due to habitat loss, pollution, disease, and other factors.
    
    Some well-known examples of amphibians include frogs like the poison dart frog, salamanders like the axolotl, and caecilians, which resemble large earthworms. Amphibians have a rich evolutionary history and are considered transitional forms between aquatic fish and terrestrial reptiles.</p>

    <p> Cuban tree frogs are nocturnal and primarily arboreal, meaning they spend a lot of their time in trees. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of insects and other small invertebrates. They have a loud and distinctive call that sounds like a series of nasal "honks."
As an invasive species, the Cuban tree frog has the potential to negatively impact local ecosystems. It can outcompete native frog species for resources and also preys on smaller native frogs. Additionally, their skin secretes a toxic mucus that can be harmful to pets and may cause skin irritation in humans.
