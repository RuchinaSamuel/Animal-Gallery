<p><span>M</span>ammals are a diverse and widespread group of animals characterized by several key features. They belong to the class Mammalia and are known for their unique traits.</p> 

<p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqsK0VhcL8o?si=nvHGWha1CbyuAM4a&amp;start=164" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <span>M</span>ammary Glands: Mammals are named for their mammary glands, which females use to nurse their young with milk. This nourishing substance provides essential nutrients for the growth and development of the offspring.

    Hair or Fur: Most mammals possess hair or fur on their bodies, which serves various purposes including insulation, camouflage, and sensory functions. Hair can vary greatly in texture, color, and thickness among different species.
    
    Warm-Blooded: Mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally. This adaptability allows them to thrive in a range of environments, from frigid polar regions to scorching deserts.
    
    Live Birth: The majority of mammals give birth to live offspring. Instead of laying eggs, as many other animals do, mammals carry their developing young internally and give birth to well-developed offspring.
    
    Complex Brains: Mammals generally have relatively large and complex brains compared to other animal groups. This contributes to their diverse behaviors and adaptability to changing environments.
    
    Diverse Habitats: Mammals occupy a wide array of habitats, including terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments. This adaptability has led to the evolution of a remarkable variety of species, from tiny shrews to massive whales.
    
    Parental Care: Many mammal species exhibit extensive parental care, ranging from protecting and nurturing young mammals to teaching them essential survival skills.
    
    Mammals include a vast range of animals, from rodents to primates, cetaceans (whales and dolphins) to carnivores, and everything in between. Their varied characteristics have enabled them to become some of the most successful and dominant animals on Earth.</p>

<p>   Physical Adaptations: Arctic Wolves have a thick, pure white coat that helps them blend in with their snowy surroundings. This fur provides insulation against the cold temperatures. They also have shorter ears and a more compact body compared to wolves in warmer climates, which helps reduce heat loss.
 Diet: Arctic Wolves primarily feed on muskoxen, caribou, and Arctic hares. They are skilled predators, working together in packs to take down larger prey.

<br> Scientific Name: CANIS ANTHUS
    <br>
Where found: Native to northern and northeastern Africa</small>
<p>    The African golden wolf belongs to the family Canidae, which also includes other canids like domestic dogs, wolves, and coyotes. It was previously considered a subspecies of the golden jackal (Canis aureus), but genetic studies have shown it to be a distinct species.
Physical Appearance: The African golden wolf has a slender and lightweight body with a golden-yellow to reddish-brown coat. It has relatively large ears, a pointed muzzle, and a bushy tail. Its size can vary, but it is generally smaller than the gray wolf.

<br> Scientific Name: CANIS LATRANS
    <br>
Where found: Found across North America.</small>
<p>   The coyote (Canis latrans) is a species of canine native to North America. It is smaller than its close relative, the wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia. The coyote is larger and more predatory and was once referred to as the American jackal by a behavioral ecologist. Other historical names for the species include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf.
 The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America. The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans; urban coyotes are common in many cities. The coyote was sighted in eastern Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in 2013.

    <br>
Where found: Southeastern United States</small>
<p> Meet the red wolf, the world's most endangered member of the dog family. Native to the United States, red wolves (Canis rufus) have a tawny, reddish coat, and they are intermediate in size between grey wolves and coyotes. That makes sense, as these two species interbred in the past to produce the red wolves' ancestors.  Red wolves have wide heads with broad muzzles, tall pointed ears and long, slender legs with large feet. Red wolves stand about 26 inches at their shoulder and are about 4 feet long from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail. Adult red wolves range in weight from about 45 to 80 pounds.

<p>   The Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), also called the Simien jackal and Simien fox, is a canine native to the Ethiopian Highlands. In southeastern Ethiopia it is also known as the horse jackal. It is similar to the coyote in size and build, and is distinguished by its long and narrow skull, and its red and white fur. Unlike most large canids, which are widespread, generalist feeders, the Ethiopian wolf is a highly specialised feeder of Afroalpine rodents with very specific habitat requirements.[5] It is one of the world's rarest canids, and Africa's most endangered carnivore.

<br> Scientific Name: CUON ALPINUS
    <br>
Where found: Native to Central, South, East and Southeast Asia.</small>
<p>   The dhole is a highly social animal, living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females. Such clans usually consist of about 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known. It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets large and medium-sized ungulates. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with the tiger (Panthera tigris) and the leopard (Panthera pardus), targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.
It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as populations are decreasing and estimated to comprise fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss, loss of prey, competition with other species, persecution due to livestock predation, and disease transfer from domestic dogs.

   In 1950, a local breeder named Nina Ennismore began a breeding program to further develop this unique coat type. She crossed Kallibunker with other cats to establish a breeding population. The resulting cats displayed the same distinctive wavy coat and slender body shape.

Where found: Mysticeti split from Odontoceti (toothed whales) between 26 and 17 million years ago between the late Oligocene or middle Miocene
</small>
<p>Mysticeti, commonly known as baleen whales, are a group of marine mammals characterized by their baleen plates instead of teeth. These whales use baleen plates to filter small organisms, like krill and plankton, from the water for food.Species: There are several species of baleen whales, including the blue whale, humpback whale, gray whale, and right whale, among others.
 Size: Baleen whales are among the largest animals on Earth. The blue whale, for example, is the largest animal to have ever existed, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) or more. Songs: Some species, like the humpback whale, are known for their complex and melodious songs, which are believed to play a role in communication and mating.</p>
